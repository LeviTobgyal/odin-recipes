        <h2><strong>Incredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of black tea or 1 teabag or 1 Tea Drop</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of brown sugar or your alternative sweetener</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup of your preferred milk</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin with boiling water in a pan or kettle. Be sure to use fresh water and spring water or filtered water is always best.</li>
            <li>In your cup, add your teabag or your tea drop. If using loose leaf tea you will need to put this in an infuser or tea strainer.</li>
            <li>Add your hot water to the cup and let the brew steep for 5 minutes. The longer you leave it to brew the stronger the tea
                will be. Don't leave it too long as it may become bitter.</li>
            <li>Strain the tea or remove the teabag. If using Tea Drops the drop will simply dissolve.</li>
            <li>Add in your sugar and stir well until all the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Pour in your milk one splash at a time, of course, you can adjust the amount until you reach your desired color and
            consistency.</li>
            <li>Stir once more and then sit back and enjoy your perfect cup of tea.</li>
        </ol>
